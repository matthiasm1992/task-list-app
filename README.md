### Instructions:

1. Setup:
   - Create a basic HTML structure with an input field for adding tasks, a button to add tasks, and a container to display the list of tasks.
2. HTML Structure: - Set up an HTML file with input elements for task input and a button to add tasks.
   Add an unordered list **_ul_** as a container to display the list of tasks.
3. JavaScript DOM Manipulation:
   - Write JavaScript code to handle adding and removing tasks dynamically.
   - Define a function to add a new task to the list.
   - Customize the content and style of the new task element.
   - Append the new task to the task list container.
4. Adding Tasks:
   - Implement an event listener on the button element to listen for clicks.
   - When the button is clicked, call the function to add a new task to the list.
5. Removing Tasks:
   - Add functionality to remove tasks.
   - Implement event delegation or attach event listeners to each task for removal.
   - Define a function to remove the clicked task from the list.
6. Optional Enhancements:
   - Allow users to mark tasks as completed.
   - Implement functionality for editing tasks.
   - Add styling and animations to enhance the user experience.
